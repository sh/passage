router.all '/users*', (req, res, next) -> next()

router.post '/users', (req, res, next) -> res.end 'post'

router.put '/users/:id', (req, res, next) ->
    # called on PUT /users/7 for example. req.params will then be {id: 7}
    res.end 'put ' + req.params.id

router.delete '/users/:id', (req, res, next) ->
